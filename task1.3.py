#A quite famous number sequence is the Fibonacci Sequence (Links to an external
# site.) where one gets the next number in the sequence by adding the two previous numbers.
#As described on the linked webpage the first two numbers are 0 and 1,
# using these numbers it is now easy to continue the sequence.
#The task is to develop a function that takes one parameter,
# the number of Fibonacci numbers to display.
# The goal of the function is to display the specified amount of numbers from the
# sequence on the screen. An example can be seen below:

number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
def fib (x):
    return number * 2

fib(number)
